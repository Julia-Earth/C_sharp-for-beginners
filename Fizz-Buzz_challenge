--- Code challenge - implement the FizzBuzz challenge rules ---

The link to the challenge: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/csharp-for/3-challenge

Here are the FizzBuzz rules that you need to implement in your code project:

  > Output values from 1 to 100, one number per line, inside the code block of an iteration statement.
  > When the current value is divisible by 3, print the term Fizz next to the number.
  > When the current value is divisible by 5, print the term Buzz next to the number.
  > When the current value is divisible by both 3 and 5, print the term FizzBuzz next to the number.

At this stage I didn't get that 'for' statement doesn't require an array to be used. That's why I initialized an array first,
and shortened numbers to 30 to not make the code too long (code performance can be seen much earlier) :)
In the correct variant of code:
  1) Don't initialize array;
  2) My 'for' expression needs to be replaced with the following: for (int i = 1; i < 101; i++)
*/

int[] numbers = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 };
		
for (int i=0; i <=29; i++)
{
    if ((numbers[i] % 3) == 0 && (numbers[i] % 5) == 0)
        Console.WriteLine($"{numbers[i]} - FizzBuzz");
		
    else if ((numbers[i] % 3) == 0)
        Console.WriteLine($"{numbers[i]} - Fizz");
		    
    else if ((numbers[i] % 5) == 0)
        Console.WriteLine($"{numbers[i]} - Buzz");
		    
    else
        Console.WriteLine(numbers[i]);
}
