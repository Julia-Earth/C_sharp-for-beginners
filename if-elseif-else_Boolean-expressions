/*
--- EVALUATE BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS ---
Initial code lines:
	string permission = "Admin|Manager";
	int level = 55;
Your application will be using a combination of 'permission' and 'level' to apply/evaluate the business rules in this challenge scenario.
Here are the Business Rules that your solution must satisfy:
	1) If the user is an Admin with a level greater than 55, output the message:
		Welcome, Super Admin user.
	2) If the user is an Admin with a level less than or equal to 55, output the message:
		Welcome, Admin user.
	3) If the user is a Manager with a level 20 or greater, output the message:
		Contact an Admin for access.
	4) If the user is a Manager with a level less than 20, output the message:
		You do not have sufficient privileges.
	5) If the user is not an Admin or a Manager, output the message:
		You do not have sufficient privileges.
